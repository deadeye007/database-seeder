# DUMMY DATABASE SEEDER

## Database Creation
The database library has been fleshed out enough to create databases as I 
have currently designed them.

TODO: Make this more generic, as practice for code reuse.

## Table Creation
The script creates several different tables:
* Customer
* Item
* Employee

## User Creation
The script creates users based on random integers from text files, obtained 
from the Internet's public domain.

##TL;DR
Seed databases with customer data for data science.
In order to be able to better analyze data, you first need data.
